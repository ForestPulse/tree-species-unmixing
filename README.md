# Tree Species Unmixing using dense time series
This repository will contain all information and scripts I used for my workflow of the tree species unmixing approach. 

## About
Forests are awesome ecosystems that play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our only planet.
Monitoring and mapping forest stands, along with accurate and current data on forest types, cover, and tree species composition, are vital for sustainable forest management.

This Method aims to map sub-pixel tree species mixtures of different tree speices in heavily mixed and strongly fragmented temperate forests like in Germany.

The workflow is seperated in the following steps:

* Step 1 [ Link ]
* Step 2 [ Link ]
* Step 3 [ Link ]
* Step 4

Test

You will find the used python and R scripts (and some documentation) in the according folders.

Feel free to use the code and adapt it to your own projects.
Just be fair when publishing it to refer to the oroginal work by me:
